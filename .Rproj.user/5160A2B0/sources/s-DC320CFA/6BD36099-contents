If you want to calculate the distance from a point to the edge of its closest polygon, and you donâ€™t have an Advanced license of ArcGIS, you can use Spatialite to do it.

Some R code here: 
```{r}
library(RSQLite)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "sql.sqlite")
```
Some SQL code here:
```{sql connection=db}
CREATE VIEW near_analysis AS
SELECT s.fid s_fid, i.fid i_fid, MIN(ST_DISTANCE(s.geometry, i.geometry)) distance
FROM sampling_points s, island i
GROUP BY s_fid
```
Some Python code here:
```{python, engine.path="/Users/me/anaconda/bin/python"}
import sys
print sys.version
```
